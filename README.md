# Project Exam 2(Holidaze)

![image](https://i.imgur.com/HL6wfPh.png)

This is made to be a Airbnb / Hotel / Accommodation site with login functions.

## Description

The project Holidaze is a website that tries to deliver housing to people around a certain area. It has
some functions. When you first see the page as a client, all you can do is view the different accommodation, send in questions via contact or take use of the the enquiries modal on a certain hotel or other housing, these will be displayed to an admin. If you are an admin you can login and you can Post new accommodations, see comments and enquiries made. Or you can delete certain accommodations if you so wish.

For the coding of the project i used React with react bootstrap and a bunch of NPM packages to name a few, React router dom, React Search Autocomplete and Axios. For the "backend" i use Strapi as headless CMS, allowing me to store the accommodations, comments or enquiries and then showing them on the pages they need to be shown. And then i just GET/POST/DELETE from the Strapi where i need to.
